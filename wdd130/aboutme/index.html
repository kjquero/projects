    <h2>Kevin John Quero</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Kevin John Quero, I am 19 years old and originally from the Philippines.<br>
        I was born and raised in Dubai, UAE up till I turned 12 years old. I am currently living in Zambia, Africa with my father.<br>
        I graduated from PathwayConnect here, and so far have been continuing my education here from Zambia.
    </p>
    <p>I have loved messing with computers since I was a kid, and I am glad to finally be able to pursue something in this field.<br>
        The degree I am pursuing is Applied Technology. My final career goal is to get into Software Engineering, I am excited to<br> 
        learn more about web development in this course/certificate and improving my coding skills along the way.  
    </p>
    <p>I enrolled in this course to expand my knowledge in the IT development field and develop skills that will help me achieve my career goals<br>
    in the future. I love BYU-Idaho and I am grateful for the opporunity I have to be part of this. I look forward to learning alongside you! C:
