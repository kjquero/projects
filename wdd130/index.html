        <p>Hello, my name is Kevin John Quero, I am 20 years old and originally from the Philippines.<br>
            I was born and raised in Dubai, UAE up until I turned 12 years old. I am currently living in Zambia, Africa with my father.<br>
            I graduated from PathwayConnect here, and so far have been continuing my education here from Zambia.
        </p>
        <p>I have loved messing with computers since I was a kid, and I am glad to finally be able to pursue something in this field.<br>
            The degree I am pursuing is Applied Technology. My final career goal is to get into Software Engineering, I am excited to<br> 
            learn more about web development in this course/certificate and improving my coding skills along the way.
